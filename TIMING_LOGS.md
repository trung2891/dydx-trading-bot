## Performance Optimization Tips

1. **Batch Size**: Larger batches = faster total time, but higher risk of rate limits
2. **Batch Delay**: Reduce delay for faster execution, increase to avoid rate limits
3. **Order Count**: More orders = longer total time, but better market coverage
4. **Order Type**: Short-term orders generally place faster than long-term orders
